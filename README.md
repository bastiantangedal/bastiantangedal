<h2 align="center">Hello! My name is Bastian. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“</h2>
<p align="center">I'm currently a high school student from :norway: pursuing Informationtechnology :student:. I love creating apps and applications that help others in their work. My current languages is C#, Java and some Web (HTML, CSS & JS). I also play games such as League of Legends and CSGO, and Chess :smile: I've started exploring the field of open-source âœ¨ and hope to contribute to that field as well. 
</p>

<p align="center">When I'm not developing and coding, you can find me watching Netflix, playing games or listening to music. Memes are something that are appreciated very much ðŸ˜‚. </p>
